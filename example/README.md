# OpenAssessIt Example

This folder contains an example audit of https://cats.com using the default Docker configuration which uses the custom templates. The [openassessit_templates](https://github.com/OpenAssessItToolkit/openassessit_templates) are fully customizable.

The generated Markdown file uses 'Markdown Extras'. To see the pretty version with fully formatted results, download the project and view the catshome.html file.  It has basic styles applied, code highlighting, and a table of contents.
